# higher-data

## Description

This codebase is a work-in-progress MEAN-stack SPA that collects and visualizes publicly-available higher education data.

It's currently not ready for production, but when deployed it will enable users to generate hundreds of thousands of unique charts and tables.

Things left to do include a few security fixes and rounding out the back-end test coverage.

Before the app can be cloned and used, the R scripts I use to pull and clean the source data will also need to be added to this repo.

Launch date is sometime in July or August. Thanks for looking!
