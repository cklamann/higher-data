---front end---

refactor form submission for table. Currently an antipattern. Should do the following:

1) validate
2) reshape form.value into mongo query (fe transformer)
3) submit

* validation should not be automatic, we should validate on ngChange, using form state to selectively validate other fields, i.e., if groupBy.variable != 'instnm', then require aggFunc, else let through, and always have a variable in there of course. Then, if valid,
pass on to transformer, which makes it into a proper queryConfig object and sends it off. Should update error handling on both sides.

---BEFORE DEPLOY---

1) make sure all routes, including create users, are covered by auth
2) remove all uniques from schemas
3) make sure exceptions from be are being handled properly
