---front end---

todo: build FE authentication

need to solve for when users come via an external link:

1) hit backend
2) return app and referer url
4) once app is loaded, link to that url, show page

front end should also have some good utilities -- should be able to get some basic intelligence on the data -- how much is there, how does it break down per school and per year? That way you can quickly check to see if any update went wrong.

---back end---

create variable collection with documentation for each variable in collection, update via front end. Only a documented variable can be used in a chart.

create chart collection that contains formulas that be will parse, get data, compute, and send

---database---

how to upload from R? mongoimport --db colleges --collection chart_data --drop --file ~/Desktop/trendsDump.json --jsonArray

#query a subset of data in mongo: 

db.chart_data.find({opeid:{$eq:"147767"},"data.variable":{$eq:"room_and_board"}})

rename: -> db.chart_data.updateMany({}, {$rename: {"opeid": "unitid"}})
