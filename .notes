---front end---

refactor form submission for table. Currently an antipattern. Should do the following:

1) validate
2) reshape form.value into mongo query (fe transformer)
3) submit

* ui logic can: turn on and off validation, but *that's it*, no intermediate transformers, save that for reshape step

---database---




---BEFORE DEPLOY---

1) make sure all routes, including create users, are covered by auth
2) remove all uniques from schemas
